# Agent OS / Agent Package Manager PRD

## Overview

`agent-os` is a workspace for managing agent packages. Its `agents` CLI is a Bun TypeScript package manager that installs and tracks agent repos, CLI adapters, skills, plugins, and shared runtime state so every managed CLI sees the same installed capabilities and credit store.

## Goals

- Manage git-backed agent packages from one workspace.
- Keep CLI-specific metadata under `.agents/clis`.
- Keep user-installed skills and plugins under `.agents/skills` and `.agents/plugins`.
- Keep harness packages under `.agents/harnesses` and launch them with shared state.
- Expose one shared state root to every CLI through `.agents/env`.
- Maintain a shared credit store at `.agents/credits.json`.
- Provide one adapter abstraction for Codex, Claude, Kimi, and Agy.
- Support CI for typecheck and tests.

## Non-Goals

- Replace package managers like npm, Bun, or uv.
- Implement billing provider integrations in the first version.
- Solve cross-machine state sync beyond git-backed packages and exportable state files.

## Users

- Agent developers who maintain several local agent repos.
- CLI users who want all agent CLIs to share skills, plugins, memory hooks, and credits.
- Automation that needs deterministic installation and environment discovery.

## Core Concepts

- Package: a git submodule or local package managed by `agents`.
- Harness: a managed runtime package, such as Agent Harness, launched by `agents`.
- CLI adapter: the shared rooting and credential contract for a vendor CLI.
- Shared state: the root `.agents` directory.
- Core package: the CLI implementation and tests under `packages/agent-package-manager`.
- Managed package checkout: a git-backed package under `packages/<name>`.
- CLI metadata: per-CLI data under `.agents/clis/<name>`.
- Skill install: files installed under `.agents/skills/<name>`.
- Plugin install: files installed under `.agents/plugins/<name>`.
- Credit store: shared JSON ledger under `.agents/credits.json`.

## Functional Requirements

- `agents list` lists registered git submodule packages.
- `agents add` adds a git-backed package.
- `agents remove` removes a package submodule.
- `agents sync` syncs and initializes submodules.
- `agents state init` creates shared directories and state files.
- `agents state env` prints environment variables every CLI should consume.
- `agents cli list|doctor|env|exec|materialize-creds` manages shared CLI adapters.
- `agents packages register|list` manages local package registrations.
- `agents harness list|doctor|run` manages harness packages.
- `agents install skill|plugin|hook|template|cli|harness` installs shared capability files into `.agents`.
- `agents installs` lists shared installs.
- `agents credits` locates or prints the shared credit store.
- `agents doctor` validates package checkouts and shared state.

## Workspace Layout

```text
packages/
  agent-package-manager/
    src/
    test/
  agi/
  agent-harness/
  skyblock-agent/
  templates/
    template-bot/
    template-cli/
    template-mono/
    template-repo/
    template-web/
  vibe-bot/
```

## State Layout

```text
.agents/
  clis/
  harnesses/
  skills/
  plugins/
  hooks/
  templates/
  credits.json
  installs.json
  packages.json
  env
```

Every managed CLI must read `AGENTS_HOME`, `AGENTS_CLIS`, `AGENTS_SKILLS`, `AGENTS_PLUGINS`, `AGENTS_HOOKS`, `AGENTS_TEMPLATES`, and `AGENTS_CREDITS` from `.agents/env` or equivalent environment exports.

## Harness Contract

Harnesses declare an `agent.package.json` manifest:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "agent-harness",
  "kind": "harness",
  "entry": "go run ./cmd/rommie",
  "workingDirectory": "services/cli",
  "requires": {
    "clis": ["codex", "claude", "kimi", "agy"],
    "state": ["skills", "plugins", "hooks", "credits"]
  }
}
```

`agents harness run <id>` launches the harness with `AGENTS_HOME` and shared state paths. Harness-specific runtime data may remain isolated under `.agents/harnesses/<id>/runtime`.

## CLI Adapter Contract

Built-in adapters:

- Codex: `CODEX_HOME=.agents/clis/codex`, credential source `~/.codex/auth.json`.
- Claude: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=.agents/clis/claude`, credential source `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
- Kimi: `KIMI_CODE_HOME=.agents/clis/kimi`, credential source `~/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json`.
- Agy: `HOME=.agents/clis/agy`, credential source `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`.

Credential materialization is explicit, non-destructive, and must not print secret values.

## CI

CI runs on pushes and pull requests to `main`:

- install Bun
- `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- `bun run check`
- `bun test`

## Milestones

1. Bun TypeScript CLI scaffold.
2. Shared state bootstrap and diagnostics.
3. Skill/plugin/CLI install tracking.
4. Credit store schema and update commands.
5. Per-CLI adapter contracts for consuming shared state.
6. Harness package install, doctor, and run commands.
7. Agent Harness bridge through `AGENTS_HOME`.
