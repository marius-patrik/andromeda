description: Prepare a compaction-safe Rommie handoff in canonical Agent OS memory and synchronize its encrypted state backup. Use when the user asks to compact, prepare for compaction, preserve current work state, make compaction useful, or before reminding the user to compact after substantial work.

# Compact

Use compact to store active work as one superseding immutable Agent OS memory
record, render canonical startup context, synchronize the encrypted state
repository, and refresh hook-compatible projections. The projections are never
memory authority.

Invariant: `$AGENTS_HOME/memory` immutable events are the sole compaction
authority. Never redirect the script to `.codex/memories`, write a second
canonical handoff, or bypass an authority mismatch with a path override.

## Workflow

1. Capture the current objective, completed work, repo/path state, validation, blockers, and exact next actions.
2. Prefer facts that a fresh agent needs to resume, not a transcript summary.
3. Run the capsule script with explicit values. It discovers `AGENTS_HOME` and
   `AGENTS_MEMORY` from `agents state env`; no memory-root override is allowed:

```powershell
pwsh -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\skills\compact\scripts\write_compaction_capsule.ps1 -Objective "current goal" -State "what is done now" -Next "next command or decision" -Validation "checks run and results" -Blockers "known blockers or None"
```

4. Verify the returned JSON has `ok=true`, a canonical record ID, a snapshot,
   a projection hash, and `repositorySynced=true`.
5. If the script detects authority drift, multiple active compaction records,
   projection-integrity failure, or state-sync failure, stop. Repair this skill
   and add a regression case before compacting; do not work around the defect.
6. If active work remains, describe the exact next action. If work is complete,
   say so without inventing follow-up work.
7. Tell the user compaction is ready and remind them to compact the task.

## Capsule Quality Bar

A useful compaction capsule names:

- Current repo paths and important commits.
- Dirty files or clean-state evidence.
- Commands already run and their results.
- Failed validations that still matter.
- The exact next action if work resumes.
- The canonical memory record, projection hash, and encrypted repository-sync
  result.
